This folder contains the notebook 'data_analysis.ipynb' which contains all the analysis performed after extraction of mean signal intensities from the ROI's.
This notebook includes, 
- Normalization of the extracted signal intensities from substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc), locus coeruleus (LC) and putamen, on extracted white matter (WM) intensities  
- Merging of the MRI data into one combined MRI dataset
- Merging MRI data with clinical data into one total dataset
- Statistical analyses: Statistical tests (PD vs HC, PIGD vs TD, HC vs PIGD vs TD vs Indeterminate), laterality assessment and effect size (Cohen's d value)
- Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) analyses: HC, PD, PIGD and TD
- Code for all plots (violin plots, bar plots) presented in the results chapter
